# # Comparison of WOVEN and DNN performance
This repository includes comparisons of two models with human behavioral performance across three tasks: (1) stiffness estimation, where humans perform well; (2) mass estimation, where humans perform at chance; and (3) a novel prediction of the effect of wind on mass estimation, which is velidated by human behavioral results. The paper detailing these results is currently under review. Please email me at wenyan.bi@yale.edu for a copy of the manuscript.
