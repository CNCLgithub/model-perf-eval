# Comparison of WOVEN and DNN performance
This repository includes comparisons of WOVEN and the DNN with human behavioral performance across three tasks: (1) stiffness estimation, where humans perform well; (2) mass estimation, where humans perform at chance; and (3) a novel prediction of the effect of wind on mass estimation, which is velidated by human behavioral results. The paper detailing these findings is currently under review. For a copy of the manuscript, please email me at [wenyan.bi@yale.edu].
